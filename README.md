# Hello there!
I'm Ubundev, an aspiring programmer that hopes to find a developer community to call home. If you have projects involving any of the languages I've listed below and think I might be a good fit, by all means, I'd be delighted to give it a shot.

- Currently beginning Rust; if you have repositories or projects with a low barrier of entry, I'll be happy to have a look.

> Of course, I am still *learning* the languages listed above, but I find myself to have enough familiarity with their syntax to start making my own projects with them. I will have a portfolio available eventually.

> This `README.md` file will likely change in the future, as time becomes more available.
